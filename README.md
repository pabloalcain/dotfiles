#DotFiles

These dotfiles are a work in progress, but mostly meant for a high
performance computing software development system with

- Debian
- Fluxbox
- Emacs for heavy text editing
- Vim for quick text editing [i e, commit messages, configuration files...]
- Cannot decide yet whether to use zsh or good ol' bash
- Other things I haven't thought of yet


Ideally installation will be covered with
[FAI](http://fai-project.org/), but maybe it is not worth it. Just to
keep tracks on the needed packages:
